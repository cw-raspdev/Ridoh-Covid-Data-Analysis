"NOTES: Congregate setting residents are included. Out-of-state residents are excluded. † Hispanic or Latino includes people who identify as any race. * All other racial and ethnic groups include people who identify as non-Hispanic ethnicity or have unknown ethnicity. 
Data reflect number of people who tested positive (rather than number of test results). Small numbers are shown as <5 in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy. We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as cyclical testing. Please use caution when interpreting these data. Risk is associated with the characteristics of settings and behaviors of people, not necessarily with race and ethnicity.",,,,,,,,,,,
