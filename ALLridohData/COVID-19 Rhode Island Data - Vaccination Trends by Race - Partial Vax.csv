"NOTES: Congregate setting residents are included. Out-of-state residents are excluded. † Hispanic or Latino includes people who identify as any race. *All other racial and ethnic groups include people who identify as non-Hispanic ethnicity or have unknown ethnicity. Vaccination data for multiple race is not available at this time as many sites do not allow for selection of multiple races at the point of data collection. 
 Data reflect the number of Rhode Island residents that have received one dose of a two-dose vaccine series. Small numbers are shown as <5 in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy. We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as vaccine availability and eligibility criteria. Please use caution when interpreting these data.",,,,,,,,,
