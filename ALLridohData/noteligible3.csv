"Notes: Numerator data reflect number of people who tested positive (rather than number of positive test results). Denominator data reflect number of test results (rather than number of people tested). Calculations based on small numbers (<5) are shown as *, in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOTE: We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as cyclical testing or peopleâ€™s movement across municipalities. Please use caution when interpreting these data. Risk is associated with the characteristics of settings and the behaviors of people, not necessarily with a geographic location.
 
Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are intentionally excluded from these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because spread within a congregate care setting does not correlate to spread within the community in which it resides, these cases and tests have been excluded from this analysis in order to provide a more accurate picture of the general COVID-19 incidence/testing within a municipality. In any scenario in which it is unclear whether a case is a congregate care resident or staff, that case is included in this analysis. In any scenario in which it is unclear whether a test was for a congregate care resident or staff, that test is excluded from this analysis.
 
 -- Data prior to week 17 are not complete, as electronic systems for sharing negative test results were being developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
