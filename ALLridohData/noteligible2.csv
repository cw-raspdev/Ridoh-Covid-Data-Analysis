"NOTE: Calculations based on small numbers (<5) are shown as *, in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy. Mortality rates are calculated based on fatality counts among people with lab-confirmed COVID-19. Deaths are reported to RIDOH by the State Medical Examiner, Vital Records, Long-Term Care and Assisted Living Facilities, and all Rhode Island Hospitals. We provide monthly data to help show more reliable trends over time. Please use caution when interpreting these data as other factors, including underlying medical conditions, can increase risk for severe illness and death.
 
Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are intentionally excluded from these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because spread within a congregate care setting does not correlate to spread within the community in which it resides, these cases have been excluded from this analysis in order to provide a more accurate picture of COVID-19 associated fatalities within the broader municipality. Out-of-state residents are also excluded from this analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
