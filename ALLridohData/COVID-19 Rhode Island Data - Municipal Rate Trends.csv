"NOTE: We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as cyclical testing or peopleâ€™s movement across municipalities. Please use caution when interpreting these data. Risk is associated with the characteristics of settings and behaviors of people, not necessarily with a geographic location.
 
Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are intentionally excluded from these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because spread within a congregate care setting does not correlate to spread within the community in which it resides, these cases have been excluded from this analysis in order to provide a more accurate picture of the general COVID-19 incidence within a municipality. In any scenario in which it is unclear whether a case is a congregate care resident or staff, that case is included in this analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
