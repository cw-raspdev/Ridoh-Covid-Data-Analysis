"NOTES: Rates based on small numbers (<5) are shown as *, in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy. We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as vaccine availability or peopleâ€™s movement across municipalities. 
 Out-of-state residents are excluded. Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are included in these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because vaccination within a congregate care setting does not correlate to vaccination within the community in which it resides, please use caution when interpreting these data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
