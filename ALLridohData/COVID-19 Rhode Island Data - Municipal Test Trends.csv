Number of COVID-19 Tests by Municipality of Residence and Week Excluding Congregate Settings Residents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Source: Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) Electronic Lab Reporting Dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Notes: Data reflect number of tests (rather than number of people tested). Small numbers are shown as <5 in line with RIDOH's Small Numbers Policy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Last updated:,1/20/2021,*The municipal test and municipal percent positive data are still being validated and will not be updated this week. Thank you for your patience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"NOTE: We provide weekly data to help show broader trends over time. Fluctuations in these data may be due to a variety of factors, such as cyclical testing or peopleâ€™s movement across municipalities. Please use caution when interpreting these data. Risk is associated with the characteristics of settings and the behaviors of people, not necessarily with a geographic location.
 
Residents in congregate care settings such as nursing homes, assisted living facilities, group homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters are intentionally excluded from these data. Because congregate care settings are not distributed equally across the state, and because spread within a congregate care setting does not correlate to spread within the community in which it resides, these tests have been excluded from this analysis in order to provide a more accurate picture of the general COVID-19 testing within a municipality. In any scenario in which it is unclear whether a test was for a congregate care resident or staff, that test is excluded from this analysis.
 
 -- Data prior to week 17 are not complete, as electronic systems for sharing negative test results were being developed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
